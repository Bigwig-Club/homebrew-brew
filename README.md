## How do I install these casks or formule?

First, install the tap:

```sh
brew tap bigwig-club/brew
```

Once the tap is installed, you can install `upic` like this:

```sh
brew cask install bigwig-club/brew/upic
```

For a list of info, you can run:

```sh
brew cask info bigwig-club/brew/upic
```

For uninstall, run:

```sh
brew cask zap bigwig-club/brew/upic
```

## Not recommanded

If you run `brew cask install upic` directly, you will install from the offical repository thich might be outdated.

> Maybe we will delete the cask from offical repository in the future.
